# Employee Tracker
Week 12 Homework
This week's project was to build a command-line application using content management systems (CMS) to manage a company's employee database using Node.Js, Inquirer, and MySQL.  THe purpose of this project is to create a CMS interface that allows non-developers the ability to view and access information in stored databases.

# Installation
1. Copy the clone link of the repository from GitHub
2. Open Bash or Terminal Window
3. When the console opens, navigate to the directory the repository will be added to
4. In the console, type the command "git clone" and paste the link to repository
5. Open repository in preferred code editor
6. Open terminal in code editor
7. Type in terminal "npm init -y" to install dependency packages needed

  Ensure the following packages are installed
- Inquirer (If not inlcuded, you can install by typing "npm install inquirer" in the terminal)
- MySQL (If not inlcuded, you can install by typing "npm install MySQL" in the terminal)
- console.table (If not inlcuded, you can install by typing "npm install console.table" in the terminal)



# Usage
1. After repository has been cloned, using MySQL run the schema.sql by typing SOURCE schema.sql. This will create the database needed for this application.
2. Start the app by running command: node server.js. Then follow the prompts to view the app's features or create new content as needed.
